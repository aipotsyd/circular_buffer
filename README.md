# circular_buffer
STL compatible buffer with some extra iterator features.

## Credits
This is largely based off the circular_buffer examples by Pete Goodlife found [here](http://goodliffe.blogspot.com/2008/11/c-stl-like-circular-buffer-part-1.html) and [here](https://accu.org/index.php/journals/389). Also, MooingDuck's SO answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7758580/writing-your-own-stl-container/7759622#7759622) and of course the standard itself (not that this yet complies with the standard).
